## 📝 Introduction

We present GeometryCrafter, a novel approach that estimates temporally consistent, high-quality point maps from open-world videos, facilitating downstream applications such as 3D/4D reconstruction and depth-based video editing or generation.

Release Notes:
- `[28/04/2025]` 🤗🤗🤗 We release our implemented SfM method for in-the-wild videos, based on [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2), [glue-factory](https://github.com/cvg/glue-factory) and [SpaTracker](https://github.com/henry123-boy/SpaTracker).
- `[14/04/2025]` 🚀🚀🚀 We provide a `low_memory_usage` option in pipeline for saving GPU memory usage, thanks to [calledit](https://github.com/calledit)'s helpful suggestion. 
- `[01/04/2025]` 🔥🔥🔥**GeometryCrafter** is released now, have fun!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TencentARC/GeometryCrafter
```
2. Install dependencies (please refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference

Run inference code on our provided demo videos at 1.27FPS, which requires a GPU with ~40GB memory for 110 frames with 1024x576 resolution:

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 576 --width 1024
  # resize the input video to the target resolution for processing, which should be divided by 64 
  # the output point maps will be restored to the original resolution before saving
  # you can use --downsample_ratio to downsample the input video or reduce --decode_chunk_size to save the memory usage
```

Run inference code with our deterministic variant at 1.50 FPS

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 576 --width 1024 \
  --model_type determ
```

Run low-resolution processing at 2.49 FPS, which requires a GPU with ~22GB memory:

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 384 --width 640
```

Run low-resolution processing at 1.76 FPS with <20GB memory usage, following the advice of [calledit](https://github.com/calledit) in [Pull Request 1](https://github.com/TencentARC/GeometryCrafter/pull/1):

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 384 --width 640 \
  --low_memory_usage True \
  --decode_chunk_size 6
```

### Visualization

Visualize the predicted point maps with `Viser`

```bash
python visualize/vis_point_maps.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --data_path workspace/examples_output/video1.npz
```

## 🤖 Gradio Demo

- Online demo: [**GeometryCrafter**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TencentARC/GeometryCrafter)
- Local demo:
  ```bash
  gradio app.py
  ```

## 📊 Dataset Evaluation

Please check the `evaluation` folder. 
- To create the dataset we use in the paper, you need to run `evaluation/preprocess/gen_{dataset_name}.py`.
- You need to change `DATA_DIR` and `OUTPUT_DIR` first accordint to your working environment.
- Then you will get the preprocessed datasets containing extracted RGB video and point map npz files. We also provide the catelog of these files.
- Inference for all datasets scripts:
  ```bash
  bash evaluation/run_batch.sh
  ```
  (Remember to replace the `data_root_dir` and `save_root_dir` with your path.)
- Evaluation for all datasets scripts (scale-invariant point map estimation):
  ```bash
  bash evaluation/eval.sh
  ```
   (Remember to replace the `pred_data_root_dir` and `gt_data_root_dir` with your path.)
- Evaluation for all datasets scripts (affine-invariant depth estimation):
  ```bash
  bash evaluation/eval_depth.sh
  ```
   (Remember to replace the `pred_data_root_dir` and `gt_data_root_dir` with your path.)
- We also provide the comparison results of MoGe and the deterministic variant of our method. You can evaluate these methods under the same protocol by uncomment the corresponding lines in `evaluation/run.sh` `evaluation/eval.sh` `evaluation/run_batch.sh` and `evaluation/eval_depth.sh`.

## 📷 Camera Pose Estimation for In-the-wild Videos

Leveraging the temporally consistent point maps output by GeometryCrafter, we implement a camera pose estimation method designed for in-the-wild videos. We hope that our work will serve as a launchpad for 4D reconstruction. Our implementation can be summarized as follows
- Segment the dynamic objects from the video with [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2). We refer to a huggingface demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/SAM2-Video-Predictor), thanks to [fffiloni](https://huggingface.co/fffiloni)'s great work.
- Find a set of feature points in the static background with SIFT and SuperPoint implemented by [glue-factory](https://github.com/cvg/glue-factory) 
- Track these points with [SpaTracker](https://github.com/henry123-boy/SpaTracker), which takes the monocular video and metric depth maps as input.
- Use gradient descent to solve the point-set rigid transformation problem (3-DoF rotation and 3-DoF translation), based on the tracking results. More details can be found in our paper.

```bash
# We provide an example here
VIDEO_PATH=examples/video7.mp4
POINT_MAP_PATH=workspace/examples_output/video7.npz
MASK_PATH=examples/video7_mask.mp4
TRACK_DIR=workspace/trackers/video7
SFM_DIR=workspace/sfm/video7

# Download the checkpoints of SpaTracker and Superpoint and put them in the following path

# You'll find the processed dataset used for 4D reconstruction in ${SFM_DIR}
```

⚠️ Camera pose estimation is **NOT** the primary objective and the core contribution of GeometryCrafter. This simplified application just demonstrates the potential for 4D reconstruction using GeometryCrafter. If you find it useful, **please help ⭐ this repo**. 

⚠️ According to our experiments, it exhibits less robustness in certain cases. Camera pose estimation for dynamic videos remains a challenging problem for researchers.
